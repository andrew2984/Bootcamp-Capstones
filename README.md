# Bootcamp-Capstones
Major bootcamp projects showing my progress

## finance_calculators
This was the first project I was tasked with creating which aimed to test my understanding of control structures and mathematical operations. It required me to calculate the returns on investments or bonds based on user input.

## task_manager
Next, I was tasked with creating a task manager that would read and write from a text file containing login information and another file containing details of tasks.

## task_manager2
This is an extension of the previous capstone project where I was required to implement edge-cases and sub-menus to edit tasks in the text file as well as create a new menu option that displays task statistics.

## inventory
Aspects of OOP is showcased in this inventory management program as I instantiated new show objects based on a text file containing information. Additional features such as adding, searching, restocking shoes were part of the criteria.

## Capstone 5
The final capstone project utilised SQLite to create a relational database in the form of a bookstore with traditional features.

Beyond these major bootcamp projects, I want to highlight a few other minor projects that showcases my understanding.

## minesweeper
I was very happy with how this turned out and, instead of sticking to a template grid, I allowed the user to create their own minesweeper base despite it not being a part of the criteria.

## watch_next
Here, I was tasked with using SpaCy, a library for natural language processing, to recommend a movie from a list based on a model synopsis.
